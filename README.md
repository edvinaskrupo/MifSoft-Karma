# Care
An app that cares about people in need.
## Vision
It is always hard to ask for help when it is needed the most.
The purpose of this app is to ensure that help could be easily provided as fast as possible.
This unified charity system application provides people a way to donate and receive unused items and contribute to various charities.
## Features
**User Profile** - users can create a profile, upload a profile picture, set up their location and a description. Every other user can see how much items you have donated.

**Inventory** - each account has its own inventory of items that are ready to be donated.

**User Interaction** - when the user finds an item that could benefit them, they can check more pictures of the item and contact its owner via integrated Live Chat, then discuss the terms of the delivery.

**Charity Support** - users can link their bank card in order to donate money to any of the available charities. Also, an automatic monthly donation to the chosen charity can be set up.
